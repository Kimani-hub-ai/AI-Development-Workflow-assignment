# AI-Based Patient Readmission Risk Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an AI system that predicts the **risk of patient readmission** within 30 days of hospital discharge. The project is developed as part of an academic assignment focused on building intelligent software solutions. The workflow follows a complete AI pipeline from problem definition to deployment and ethical reflection.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Hospitals face high costs and strained resources due to patient readmissions. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can:
- Predict readmission risk using electronic health records (EHRs)
- Assist healthcare providers in taking proactive steps
- Improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary readmissions

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a predictive model using patient data (e.g., demographics, medical history)
- Evaluate model performance using key metrics
- Address data bias, ethical concerns, and deployment scalability
- Integrate the solution within hospital systems, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA)

---

## 🧠 AI Model Used

- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Reason**: High accuracy, robustness to overfitting, interpretability
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 🛠️ Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, feature encoding
- Model Training: Split into training, validation, and test sets
- Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
- Visualization: Feature importance, confusion matrix
- Bias Mitigation: Stratified sampling and fairness-aware data review
- Overfitting Control: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
